                Hello! I'm Jack Savage, the Editor of Arms behind Savage's Heraldic Journal. I'm a passionate heraldry enthusiast on a journey to explore the fascinating world of coats of arms and heraldic symbols.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey into heraldry began during my second year at the University of Hull, coinciding with my rediscovery of road cycling. As I pedaled through the serene East Yorkshire countryside, I stumbled upon the village of Roos and its intriguing coat of arms, which sparked my curiosity and set the foundation for this journal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the world of cycling and heraldry, I'm a firm believer in preserving the rich traditions of the past. Through Savage's Heraldic Journal, I aim to share my discoveries, insights, and musings on this timeless art of symbolism and storytelling. Together, we'll uncover the hidden meanings behind coats of arms and explore their relevance in the modern world.

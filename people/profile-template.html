      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        George Ball was born in Romford in 1888 to Frederick Ball and Ethel Rhoda
        Smith. A railway clerk by profession, he was known locally for his stern
        manner and impeccable handwriting. He married Ethel in 1913 and the two
        remained together for more than sixty years.
      </p>
      <p>
        He lived most of his adult life in Brentwood and served on the parish
        council for many years. His descendants regard him as the quiet
        patriarch of the family.

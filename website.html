                Since starting my second year of university at Hull I have also started road cycling again. I've been getting out most weeks and exploring the flat country
                lanes of East Yorkshire. On one of my rides to the seaside town of Withernsea, I cycled through a village called Roos which bore an interesting coat of arms.
                It was a field of Gules charged with three unusual objects. It was on the welcome sign to the village and on the sign of the local pub. When I got home after
                the ride I researched to find that the arms belonged to Robert de Ros, one of the twenty-five barons appointed to monitor King John's observance of
                the Magna Carta. I also found out what the unusual objects were. Water Bougets. They are a pair of water bags on a yoke and it seems their only relevance 
                today is in the form of heraldry. I'll be on the lookout on my future rides to see if I can find any more unique heraldic elements such as that. Until next
                time. <br>

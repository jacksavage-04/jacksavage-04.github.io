                Since starting my second year of university at Hull I have also started road cycling again. I've been getting out most weeks and exploring the flat country
                lanes of East Yorkshire. On one of my rides to the seaside town of Withernsea, I cycled through a village called Roos which bore an interesting coat of arms.
                It was a field of Gules charged with three unusual objects. It was on the welcome sign to the village and on the sign of the local pub. When I got home after
                the ride I researched to find that the arms belonged to Robert de Ros, one of the twenty-five barons appointed to monitor King John's observance of
                the Magna Carta. I also found out what the unusual objects were. Water Bougets. They are a pair of water bags on a yoke and it seems their only relevance 
                today is in the form of heraldry. I'll be on the lookout on my future rides to see if I can find any more unique heraldic elements such as that. Until next
                time. <br>

                    When talking about the forms in which British peerages are presented, there is usually a standard style followed with a few exceptions that still 
                    technically conform to this style. Barons and Viscounts are followed by Surnames or Surnames and Locations e.g. Baron True and Viscount Colville 
                    of Culross. Exceptions to this rule mainly lie in Scotland. Scottish Barons, who are not peers, are styled as Baron of Y. Early Scottish Viscountcies 
                    also used the preposition of though nowadays it is customary to drop the of and style them as Viscount X e.g. The Viscount of Falkland is now styled 
                    as Viscount Falkland. Earls are styled as either Earl X, Earl X of Y, or Earl of Y, not many ways to break that rule though we'll come back to that.
                    Marquesses are styled as Marquess of Y except in a handful of cases such as The Marquess Cornwallis and The Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, with the latter still
                    being extant. Dukes are the one title which has never strayed from the norm, always Duke of Y, no problem there. <br>
                <br>
                    All of that brings me to the peculiar title I'll be talking about today. Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. That is one title, not two separate titles 
                    held by a single peer, a single title granted in the same letter patent with the same remainder. The grantee of this title was the Rt Hon. Robert 
                    Harley. An English statesman who held several positions within parliament such as Lord High Treasurer, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Speaker 
                    of the House. He was the son of Sir Edward Harley, a Puritan parliamentarian who fought during the First English Civil War. His political career 
                    started in 1689 when he was elected as the parliamentary representative of Tregony until 1670 when he was elected by the constituency of New Radnor, 
                    a position he held till he was elevated to the peerage in 1711.<br>
                <br>
                    To understand why he was given this extraordinary title we must look at the first part of the title, Earl of Oxford. The Earldom of Oxford was first 
                    created for Aubrey de Vere, an English nobleman born circa 1115 who was Count of Guînes jure uxoris. That title was passed down for the next 500 
                    years until it passed to Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford. The Earl had one son who survived infancy with actress Hester Davenport. After 
                    disagreements and an affair the Earl married another woman, Diana Kirke, and declared that his marriage to Davenport wasn't official and that he had 
                    staged it. That made his one son illegitimate and unable to succeed him in the title so when the 20th Earl died in 1703 the title became dormant with 
                    no clear successor.<br>
                <br>
                    With one of the oldest titles in the peerage of England now in a state of confusion and Harley being granted a peerage, who laid claim to the title through 
                    marriage, he decided to go for it. He chose the title Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer in case any other claimant challenged the former title (Hill 1988). 
                    The title passed down until the 6th Earl (6th Earl and Earl?) who had no heirs and so the title became extinct in 1853. This wasn't the last time the Earldom of 
                    Oxford tried to be claimed. In 1925 the Earldom of Oxford and Asquith was created for British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. He wanted to be only the Earl of Oxford 
                    though there was offense taken from both the de Vere family and the Harley family. A compromise was made and he became the Earl of Oxford and Asquith though only 
                    Earl of Oxford was used day to day. This annoyed both families. The title is still extant with Asquith's great-grandson Raymond Asquith being the 3rd Earl of Oxford 
                    and Asquith.<br>
                <br>
                    And there we have it, why this unique double title came into existence and the prestige behind it. I hope you enjoyed my first-ever blog, I look forward to writing more 
                    on the ins and outs of heraldic subjects.<br>
